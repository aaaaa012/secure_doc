# Business Overview

## Project Background
**SecureDoc** is a secure document sharing platform designed to facilitate the safe exchange of sensitive information between users. In an era where data privacy is paramount, SecureDoc provides a robust solution for uploading, storing, and sharing documents via encrypted channels and QR codes.

## Problem Statement
Current document sharing methods (email, public cloud links) often lack necessary security controls or are too complex for quick, temporary sharing. Users need a way to share documents securely without requiring the recipient to have a permanent account or complex setup, while ensuring the data remains protected.

## Solution Vision
SecureDoc offers a streamlined web application where users can:
- Securely upload documents to a protected storage system.
- Generate unique QR codes and access codes for sharing.
- Control access to their documents with authentication and expiration mechanisms.

## Target Audience
- **Professionals**: Lawyers, doctors, and consultants sharing sensitive client data.
- **Enterprises**: Internal teams sharing confidential reports.
- **General Users**: Individuals sharing private personal documents securely.

## Key Success Indicators
- **Adoption Rate**: Number of active users uploading documents.
- **Security Incidents**: Zero data breaches or unauthorized access events.
- **User Satisfaction**: Ease of use ratings for the QR code sharing feature.
